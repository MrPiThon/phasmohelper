                <h2>Haunted Mirror</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The haunted mirror can be activated by right-clicking while holding it in your hands.</li>
                    <li>When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the ghost's favourite room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference.</li>
                    <li>While active, the mirror creates a faint glow over the shown area, which all players can see, even outside of the mirror.</li>
                    <li>Can only be used while inside the investigation area.</li>
                    <li>Each use of the mirror drains 7.5% sanity per second, but no less than 20%. This means that using the mirror for less than 2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity.</li>
                    <li>If the user's sanity reaches zero, the mirror will break and initiate a cursed hunt.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Music Box</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The music box can be activated by right-clicking while holding it in your hand. Doing so will end the setup phase early if it is ongoing.</li>
                    <li>If the box is within 20 metres of the ghost, the ghost will sing along, broadcasting its location.</li>
                    <li>If the box is within 5 metres of the the ghost, it will trigger a Ghost Event where the ghost manifests and begins to walk towards it.</li>
                    <li>During this Ghost Event, if the ghost reaches the music box or spends more than 5 seconds walking towards it, it will initiate a cursed hunt.</li>
                    <li>The box can be placed on the ground while active. However, if thrown while active, it will initiate a cursed hunt.</li>
                    <li>Being within 2.5 metres of an active music box drains the player's sanity at a rate of 2.5%/s, totaling 75% if the entire song is listened to. This applies to all players within the range.</li>
                    <li>It can only be used once.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Ouija Board can be activated by left-clicking on it if the player is not holding it, or by right-clicking while holding it.</li>
                    <li>Once activated, the planchette will appear, cancelling the setup phase if it is ongoing.</li>
                    <li>The player can then ask the various questions listed below, each costing some amount of sanity.</li>
                    <li>To deactivate the Ouija Board, the player must say "Goodbye", which will make the planchette disappear.</li>
                    <li>If the player who activated the board walks away from an active Ouija Board, or has insufficient sanity to "pay" for the question that they ask, the board will break and initiate a cursed hunt.</li>
